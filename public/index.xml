      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Post 1: Analyzing the Popular Vote and Swing States, with a Focus on North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is part of an ongoing assignment for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor Ryan Enos. Throughout the semester, we will explore historical election data and use it to forecast the outcome of the 2024 election.&#xA;Introduction: Analyzing Changes in the Democratic Vote (2016-2020)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this week&amp;rsquo;s analysis, I focus on understanding the Democratic vote swing between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections as these were the elections in which Donald Trump won and lost. I believe that this will help to enlighten which trends could have positive partisanship towards Kamala Harris in swing states. This shift, especially in states like North Carolina, plays a crucial role in defining future election outcomes. The map below illustrates how the Democratic vote share changed across key states between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
