#The Economy and Electoral Outcomes: Understanding the Link Through Third Quarter GDP Growth and Unemployment#

_This blog is part of an ongoing assignment for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor [Ryan Enos](https://www.ryandenos.com). Throughout the semester, we will explore historical election data and use it to forecast the outcome of the 2024 election._


In American presidential elections, economic performance has long been considered one of the most significant factors influencing voter behavior. This year is no different, as the state of the economy will likely be a decisive factor in shaping the outcome of the 2024 election. Economic indicators such as GDP growth and unemployment rates, particularly in the months leading up to the election, offer insight into how voters may judge the incumbent party. At least that's the average believe, that economy determines whether a party succeeds in the election or looses. 

In this blog post, I will examine the relationship between third-quarter GDP growth and unemployment rates and if these factors correlate with the incumbent party’s share of the popular vote.


*GDP Growth and Popular Vote Share*

GDP growth, particularly in the third quarter, is commonly seen as a measure of economic health that can significantly influence voters' decisions. Historically, stronger GDP growth was assumed to be associated with higher vote shares for the incumbent party, while weaker or negative growth signaled trouble. *However, this graph suggests a different story.*

In the plot below, the relationship between third-quarter GDP growth and the incumbent party's national popular vote share appears to be **negative**, contrary to conventional expectations. This means that, surprisingly, higher GDP growth in the third quarter correlates with a **decrease** in the incumbent party's vote share.
